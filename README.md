## About

This is a Docker image for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/) - the Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

The Docker image currently supports:

* running SABnzbd under its __own user__ (not `root`)
* changing of the __UID and GID__ for the SABnzbd user
* changing the `host_whitelist` setting for compatibility with [hostname verification](https://sabnzbd.org/hostname-check)
* support for OpenSSL / HTTPS encryption
* support for __RAR archives__
* support for __ZIP archives__
* support for __7Zip archives__ ([with SABnzbd version >= 0.8](#improvements-for-sabnzbd-version--08))
* support for the latest `par2` repair utility ([improved with SABnzbd version >= 0.8](#improvements-for-sabnzbd-version--08))

## Run

### Run via Docker CLI client

To run the SABnzbd container you can execute:

```bash
docker run --name sabnzbd -v <datadir path>:/datadir -v <media path>:/media -v <watched path>:/watched -v <backup path>:/backup -e SABNZBD_UID=1234 -e SABNZBD_GID=1234 -p 8080:8080 sabnzbd/sabnzbd
```

Open a browser and point it to [http://my-docker-host:8080](http://my-docker-host:8080)

### Run via Docker Compose

You can also run the SABnzbd container by using [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/docker-compose).

If you've cloned the [git repository](https://github.com/domibarton/docker-sabnzbd) you can build and run the Docker container locally (without the Docker Hub):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to use the Docker Hub image within your existing Docker Compose file you can use the following YAML snippet:

```yaml
sabnzbd:
    image: "sabnzbd/sabnzbd"
    container_name: "sabnzbd"
    volumes:
        - "<datadir path>:/datadir"
        - "<media path>:/media"
        - "<watched path>:/watched" 
        - "<backup path>:/backup"
    ports:
        - "8080:8080"
    restart: always
```

## Configuration

### Volumes

Please mount the following volumes inside your SABnzbd container:

* `/datadir`: Holds all the SABnzbd data files (e.g. config, postProcessing)
* `/media`: Directory for media (downloaded files)
* `/watched`: local path to watch for nzb files
* `/backup`: local path to backup nzb files

### Configuration file

By default the SABnzbd configuration is located on `/datadir/config.ini`.
If you want to change this you've to set the `CONFIG` environment variable, for example:

```
CONFIG=/datadir/sabnzbd.ini
```

### UID and GID

By default SABnzbd runs with user ID and group ID `666`.
If you want to run SABnzbd with different ID's you've to set the `SABNZBD_UID` and/or `SABNZBD_GID` environment variables, for example:

```
SABNZBD_UID=1234
SABNZBD_GID=1234
```

### Hostname verification and updating `host_whitelist`

Starting with version 2.3.3 SABnzbd implements [hostname verification](https://sabnzbd.org/hostname-check)
to protect against DNS hijacking attacks. Thus by default SABnzbd allows access
to the web interface only by either accessing it directly by IP address or by
the hostname of the machine on which it runs. But the IP address or hostname of
the running Docker instance is not always available or accessible from the
outside (especially when running in Kubernetes).

You can work around this by setting the container hostname with
`docker create -h sabnzbd.example.com ...` when creating the container. This
will allow you to access SABnzbd by `http://sabnzbd.example.com:8080` by
default.

You can also use set the environment variable `HOST_WHITELIST_ENTRIES` to a
string of comma-separated values of hostnames and FQDNs under which SABnzbd
should be accessible. This will update the [`host_whitelist` special setting](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/configuration/2.3/special)
with those values. Note that the container's hostname is always included in
this whitelist. For example:

```
HOST_WHITELIST_ENTRIES="sabnzbd.example.com, sabnzbd.other.example.net"
```

## Improvements for SABnzbd version > 0.8

SABnzbd brings a lot of improvements in version `0.8` and greater. This image is built to use those improvements, which means:

* you can use the latest `par2` utility and set _Extra PAR2 Parameters_ in your SABnzbd config switches
  * `-t` for using `par` with multi-core CPUs (see also [this wiki page](http://wiki.sabnzbd.org/configure-switches#multi-core))
  * `-N` to improve failed repairs (see also [this forum thread](http://forums.sabnzbd.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=19913#p103827))
* you can use 7Zip to unpack `.7z` archives
